== 0.2.0 2009-12-14

This is the first release of cucumber-rails, which was factored out of cucumber.
We're calling it 0.2.0 just because we did some prereleases in the 0.1 series,
and to celebrate that cucumber-rails now supports Capybara as an alternative to Webrat.

=== UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS CUCUMBER SETUP

1) Remove your features/support/version_check.rb
2) Remove your features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb
   If you have added your own custom step definitions to this file,
   put them in a different file under features/step_definitions
3) run "ruby script/generate cucumber --help" to see what options you have.
4) run "ruby script/generate cucumber" - plus whatever options you think fit for you.
   Answer "n" (no) when asked to overwrite paths.rb.
   Answer "y" (yes) when asked to overwrite other files, but do "d" (diff) first.
   If you have edits in some of these files that you want to keep, store the diff
   in a temporary file and reapply after you have overwritten the file. ALso consider
   adding your custom code to another file that won't be overwritten the next time
   you upgrade.
   
   Many people have edits in their env.rb file. This is something you should try
   to avoid in the future. Instead, keep your custom setup in a different file
   under features/support - Cucumber loads all files under features/**/*.rb anyway.
   
   If you have a Spork setup, see the end of this thread:
