Feature: Disable automatic database cleaning

  By default, a set of Before/After hooks are installed to
  invoke database_cleaner on every scenario except those tagged
  "@no-database-cleaner". Sometimes when a user is switching between
  cleaning strategies, this can initiate an undesired database
  transaction.

  To avoid the need for users making frequent strategy switches to apply
  this tag, a configuration option is provided so that the user can
  control the invocation of database_cleaner explicitly.

  Scenario: Disabling automatic cleaning
    Given I have created a new Rails app and installed cucumber-rails
    And I append to "features/env.rb" with:
      """
      Cucumber::Rails::Database.autorun_database_cleaner = false
      """
    And I write to "features/widgets.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: Create widgets

          When I create 3 widgets
