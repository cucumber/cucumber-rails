  Background: A simple calendar app
    Given I have created a new Rails 3 app "rails-3-app" with cucumber-rails support
    And I successfully run `bundle exec rails g scaffold appointment name:string when:datetime`

  Scenario Outline: Use a particular driver
    Given I write to "features/create_appointment.feature" with:

          Given I am on the new appointment page

          And I select "2009-02-20 15:10:00 UTC" as the "When" date and time
          And I press "Create Appointment"
          Then I should see "Norway's constitution"
