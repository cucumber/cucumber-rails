Feature: Allow Cucumber to rescue exceptions

  Background: A controller that raises an exception
    Given I have created a new Rails app "rails-3-app" and installed cucumber-rails
    And I write to "app/controllers/posts_controller.rb" with:
      """
      class PostsController < ApplicationController

      Rails3App::Application.routes.draw do
        resources :posts
