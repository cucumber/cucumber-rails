Description:
    Sets up Cucumber in your Rails project. After running this generator you will
    get a new rake task called features.
    
    This also generates the necessary files in the features directory.
    
Examples:
    `rails generate cucumber:install`

    `rails generate cucumber:install --help`

    You can also provide a language argument for localized web_steps:
    `rails generate cucumber:install de`
