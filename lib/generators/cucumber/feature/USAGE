Description:
    Generates a skeleton for a new feature. Both a simple .feature file and
    a steps.rb file is generated. This generator should be used with moderation.
    See https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Feature-Coupled-Steps-(Antipattern)
    for details about the dangers involved.

    This generator can take an optional list of attribute pairs similar to Rails'
    built-in resource generator.

Examples (Rails 3):
    `script/rails generate cucumber:feature post` # no attributes
    `script/rails generate cucumber:feature post title:string body:text published:boolean`

Examples (Rails 2):
    `script/generate feature post` # no attributes
    `script/generate feature post title:string body:text published:boolean`
